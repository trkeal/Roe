============================================
this is corruptware of the source code to roe2

roe2 got as far as .26 and was great...
but this is the crap ass lesser version.

i tried repairing the file structure so that it wont crash...

but it still is blah...

try clicking around with the mouse unitl you find creatures that status conition pops up for... that means you can control them...
use level up to gain abilities such as MOVE and INSPECT... without those you cant do much of anything!
