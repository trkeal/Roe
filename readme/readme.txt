=== Roe 18a Version History ===

In Roe 18a 2021-1130-1731 I forgot to disable the encounter system's debug logging.

Look at the batch file to see how it compiles.

Also refer to the devnotes.txt in the readme folder.

"H" at the splash takes you thru the help manual / tutorial / player's guide

I made some minor updates to the game that were left out from the fork at revision 18.

18a is the rollback.

26 was the point at which the project died due to a data loss incident.

38 was the point at which I had to perform the rollback to 18a.

18a is 1:1 / 100% accurate to the point of the fork, just with the engine being constantly updated.

18a orginally used the 17 map, but I had to update the game logic to match the 26's map format.
